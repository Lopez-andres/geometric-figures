# ADA Project – Geometric Figures on the Cartesian Plane

This project implements a tool to analyze geometric figures from lists of points on the Cartesian plane. It includes figure detection, graphing, and area calculation, using algorithms developed from scratch following the principles of Algorithm Analysis and Design.

## ✅ Functionalities
- Handling multiple lists of points.

- Identification of possible figures:

- Rectangle

- Square

- Acute triangle

- Right triangle
- Counting how many figures can be formed per list.

- Graphing points on the Cartesian plane.

- Graphing the selected figures.

- Calculation and storage of the area of ​​each figure, ordered from smallest to largest.

## 🧠 Algorithmic Approach
All methods were implemented without libraries that reduce the algorithmic analysis. Each module includes its pseudocode, desktop test, and cost analysis.
